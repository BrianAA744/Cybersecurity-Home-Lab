# Cybersecurity-Home-Lab

In this project, I built a virtual home lab environment to simulate a network attack using Kali as the attack machine and Ubuntu as the target machine. Then the network traffic was analyzed using Wireshark, by installing it from Ubuntu.

The purpose of this lab was to get some hands-on experience with creating a virtual home lab, and also using some Linux distributions (Ubuntu and Kali) along with using networking tools like Wireshark. The hypervisor I used was Oracle VirtualBox.

Firstly, I set up Ubuntu and Kali on the VirtualBox hypervisor, and updated both systems, and installed all the additional tools I would need using the terminal.

Next, I simulated an attack from Kali, with Ubuntu as my target machine. Then I used Ubuntu to install Wireshark as the networking tool that would capture the network traffic.
